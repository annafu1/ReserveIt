# ReserveIt

## **About:**

My passion project is to learn how to build a user-friendly reservation website called “Reserve It”.  It will allow patrons to make restaurant reservations with flexibility, precise instructions, and providing a consumer-focused approach to enhance their dining experience.

## **How it works:**

Customers would search for the restaurant that they would like to eat at, and then be directed to another page to choose the following information:

- (Required) Time
- (Required) Date
- (Required) Number of guests
- (Required) Where they want to be seated with a table layout
- (Required) Preordering items from the menu

On the day of the reservation, patrons would receive a booking reminder of their reservation either through SMS text message or e-mail based on their profile’s selected preference. They would then have to confirm the reservation within 3 hours prior to their reservation. If the patrons do not provide a confirmation, the restaurants would reserve the right to cancel the appointment.

### **Features on the site:**

- Food place recommendations based on previous interests
- User history of favorite table
- User history of food ordered
- User reviews
