# ReserveIt

## **About:**

My passion project is to learn how to build a user-friendly reservation website called “Reserve It”.  It will allow patrons to make restaurant reservations.

## **How it works:**

Customers would click on the button in the homepage to reserve a table and then be directed to another page to choose the following information:

- (Required) Time
- (Required) Date
- (Required) Number of guests

### **Features on the site coming soon:**

- Food place recommendations based on previous interests
- User history of favorite table
- User history of food ordered
- User reviews
- Customers to recieve a booking reminder through SMS text message
- Reserving table option: Where they want to be seated with a table layout
- Reserving table option: Preordering items from the menu
